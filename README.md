# Fallen Angel

<p align="justify">
	A C++ library to contain any function, container, or type that 	requires memory management. It is for usage in high level languages using binding libraries.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	Currently the Rust binding is empty, and the library itself is actually a console app for testing purposes. The app will simply read the file <code>w9d02_obj_area00.gedit</code> and print the data of the container.
