# Terminology
Here are some terms that I wanna make very clear what I mean by them throughout the project.
* **Memory Width:** The amount of bytes that something occupies in memory.
* **Size:** The memory width of something not including metadata like the size of the buffer for example.
* **Count:** Should be self explanatory, but for completion's and clarity's sake, this always refers to the amount of something in a collection, for example
